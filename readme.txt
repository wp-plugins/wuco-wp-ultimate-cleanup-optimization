WUCO aka WP Ultimate Cleanup & Optimization, an easy to use yet effective plugin designed to help you keep your MySQL database clean.

== Description ==
WordPress stores a lot of excess information in your DB (like post revisions, auto drafts, spam and trashed comments, transient site options, etc.).
Of course there's a reason for that and some of this data is needed once in a while, but most of it is not critical. It just sits there taking up the space and never being used.
Over the time as your site grows the volume of this unused data grows with it making your database unreasonably huge thus effecting the site's overall performance.

Using WUCO you can easily and safely clean out those useless entries from your database. With a single click you can remove revisions, drafts, auto drafts, orphaned post and comment meta, transient data and much more.

== Installation ==
1. Log in to your WordPress Admin Panel.
2. Go to Plugins and activate Wuco - WordPress Ultimate Cleanup & Optimization.
3. Then go to WUCO Settings page.
